# Exercise 1:
 Create a console-based application whose Main() method asks the user to input an integer 
and then calls a method named MultiplicationTable(), which displays the results of 
multiplying the integer by each of the numbers 2 through 10

# Exercise 2:
 Create a console-based program whose Main() method prompts the user for an integer 
value and, in turn, passes the value to a method that squares the number and to a method 
that cubes the number. The Cube() method should call the Square() method. The Main() 
method displays the results returned from each of the other methods.


# Exercise 3:
 Create a method named Sum() that accepts any number of integer parameters and displays 
their sum. Write a Main() method that demonstrates the Sum() method works correctly
when passed one, three, or five integers, or an array of ten integers
